# 📏 Dating App Height Perception

## 🎯 About
This is a fun and silly Python program that determines how your height is perceived on dating apps based on your gender, orientation, and height.

**⚠️ Warning:** This is purely for entertainment purposes. Expect sarcasm, exaggeration, and brutal honesty.

🚀 **Spoiler Alert:** If you're a straight man under 6 feet, brace yourself.

## 🛠️ How It Works
- The program asks for your Gender (`M` = Male, `F` = Female, `O` = Other).
- It then asks for your Orientation (`S` = Straight, `G` = Gay, `B` = Bi).
- You enter your Height in Feet & Inches.
- The program then delivers the hard truth (or a compliment, if you're lucky).
